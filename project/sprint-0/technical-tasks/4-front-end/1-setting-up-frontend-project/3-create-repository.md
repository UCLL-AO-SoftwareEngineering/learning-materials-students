# Create repository

## 1. Acceptance Criteria

At the end of this task you should have a repository in which you can work on the frontend.

## 2. Implementation Details

1. Accept the Frontend GitHub classroom assignment. You can find
   the link to the assignment on Toledo under "Opdrachten en examens" > "GitHub Classroom links" > "Frontend assignment"
1. Clone the empty repository to your computer.
   Note: if your GitHub username contains capital letters, then your
   repository will contain capital letters as well, which won't be accepted by
   `create-next-app`. You'll have to clone it under an alias, like:
   ```
   git clone <your github clone URL> <your alias without capital letters>
   ```
